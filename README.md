## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript


## Lessons Learned:

During this project, I reinforced the concepts of creating buttons in HTML and styling the layout using flexbox css. I was also able to get additional practice with using the .addEventListener method, assigning functions to the buttons, and displaying the results to the DOM.
